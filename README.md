# **Flask Graphing Calculator** 📊  

A simple yet powerful **Graphing Calculator** built using **Flask** and **Plotly**. This application allows users to plot multiple mathematical equations dynamically on the same graph. Each graph is assigned a **unique ID**, making it shareable and revisitable later.  

---

## **Features** 🌟  
✅ **Dynamic Graphing** – Enter multiple equations and visualize them instantly.  
✅ **Multiple Colors** – Each equation is displayed in a different color for better visibility.  
✅ **Equation Management** – Add or remove equations dynamically.  
✅ **Persistent Graphs** – Each graph has a **unique ID** and can be revisited later.  
✅ **Math Functions Supported** – `sin(x)`, `cos(x)`, `tan(x)`, `log(x)`, `sqrt(x)`, and more!

## **How to Run the Project** 🛠  

### **1️⃣ Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jeet-programmer/equation-to-graph.git
cd equation-to-graph
```

### **2️⃣ Install Dependencies**  
```bash
pip install flask plotly numpy
```

### **3️⃣ Run the Flask App**  
```bash
python app.py
```

### **4️⃣ Open in Browser**  
Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser.

## **Usage Guide** 🎯  

### **➤ Adding Equations**  
Simply enter equations in terms of `x`. Some example equations:  

✅ **Linear:** `x + 2`  
✅ **Quadratic:** `x**2 - 4`  
✅ **Trigonometric:** `sin(x)`, `cos(x)`, `tan(x)`  
✅ **Logarithmic:** `log(x)`  
✅ **Exponential:** `exp(x)`  
✅ **Square Root:** `sqrt(x)`  
✅ **Absolute Value:** `abs(x - 3)`  

### **➤ Removing Equations**  
Click the **"Remove"** button next to an equation to delete it from the graph.  

### **➤ Sharing Graphs**  
Every graph has a **unique ID**. Once you generate a graph, you’ll see a **Graph ID** like this:  
```
Graph ID: 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000
```
Visit: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/graph/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000` to access it later.

### **➤ Starting a New Graph**  
Click **"New Graph"** to clear all equations and start fresh.
